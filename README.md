# Geo-Fencing-using-GPS-
Geo-fencing (geofencing) is a feature in a software program that uses the global positioning system (GPS) or radio frequency identification (RFID) to define geographical boundaries.IN This project we are using GPS  module.
BY using adadrui.io create an account and make feeds.
create a dashboard that links to your feed . so that data will show in  your dashboard .
In dashboard create a block location that is shows the gps data.
for geo fencing we have to make an account to the IFTTT or we can write the location loop in the code
in IFTTT we make applet and we use IF THIS THEN THAt and create a new applet.
In new applet we write the location data.
we can also create trigger by using dashboard that also useful for location.
